##Ping CSUS
A python script to login to school servers and see how many users are online, the uptime, and the load. The information is then stored to database where I'll write some python scripts to do analysis.

To run the script locally, make sure you have Python and virtualenv, edit your password in a file called "PASSWORD.TXT". Then simply type the following and open your localhost

``` python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
``` python
python app.py
```
